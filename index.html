Hanamichi was reluctant to join the team at first as he had no previous sports background (and because the fiftieth girl rejected him for a basketball player), but despite his immaturity and hot temper, he proves to be a natural athlete with potential, initially joining the team in order to impress Haruko, but later coming to love the sport and working his best to help the team win the nationals.</p>
